   GNOME Klotski is a set of block sliding puzzles. The objective is to move the
   patterned block to the area bordered by green markers. To do so, you'll need
   to slide other blocks out of the way. Complete each puzzle in as few moves as
   possible!
  </_p>
  <_p>
   GNOME Klotski comes with nearly thirty different puzzle layouts of varying
   difficulty. Some of the layouts are similar and only the size of one or more
   blocks differ. Other layouts have more variety.
